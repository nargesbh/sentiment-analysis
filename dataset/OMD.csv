4,Wow...the CSPAN people are explaining what Twitter is to the audience...#debate08,
4,McCain +3 for admitting that the US engaged in torture! #tweetdebate,
4,@disavian I agree.  It's tough to see an old war horse like McCain take empty swipes.  He'll have his place back in the Senate when he loses,
4,@jpippert The I wore my tie that looks good on the radio tie? Oh yes. Smooth move, McCain. #debate08,
4,@ pavlicko you gained at least one follower from searching tweetscan for #debate08 and then drilling down to read your comments.,

4,All McCain has is lies why can't he just tell the American people the truth. #current,
4,@stevenbjohnson he said don't torture... ever again. pretty clearly. #debate08,
4,@janoss - re: emotive - neither candidate has it, but I met Obama in Chicago...so I'm biased. Obama likes to meet eye-to-eye.,
4,CNN played Kissinger's response proving McCains answer correct. #debate08,
4,the debate was a draw.  I thought Mccain did come out slightly on top because he sounded more educated on the issues. good closing.#debate08,

4,#debate08 I love watching comments roll in on Twitter's Election2008!,
4,@lindagoin To be honest, I've never had much passion for Obama. I just can't stand McCain anymore.  Obama's been growing on me though lately,
4,@janoss - So, IMO, Obama won in his eye-to-eye, direct points, and his mission. The differences were very clear tonight.,
4,#current  Why the obsessions on both right and left with who won? Both candidates clarified their positions--the viewers were the winners.,
4,For what it's worth, McCain is kicking Obama's ass on the Drudge poll. #debate08,

4,#debate08 @drunnells agreed!,
4,Obama said McCain was right on several issues! #debate08,
4,#debate08 Mccain mostly had his advantage by violating Lehrer's moderating.That he tied/slightly won on his strongest suit is encouraging,

4,#debate08 Great coverage on CNN measuring audience responses in real-time.,
4,Biden on MSNBC: A good night for our team. #debate08,

4,#debate08 the CW (Halperin) says Obama A- McCain B-, sounds about right http://tinyurl.com/4q7f8d,

4,#debate08 @kcrusher Nuclear all the way. We need to explore that territory more.,

4,Biden is the MAN! #debate08,
4,I think McCain won this debate easily #current,
4,@Imarilove Yes, He did. I liked the eye contact. #debate08 #tweetdebate,
4,Bloggers right; mccain won because it is his issue. #debate08,
4,Anyone trying to say John McCain is a liar, suffers misanthropy. John McCain likes anyone that likes him first. It's how he rolls! #debate08,
4,CNN post debate polling is saying the debate went to Obama with over a 10 point lead #debate08 #current,
4,Very big Obama lead in the CNN post debate poll. Interesting. #debate08,
